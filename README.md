# iic-circdia

This is a fork of Stefan Krause's `circdia` LaTeX package (<http://www.taylorgruppe.de/circdia/>) with modifications for the Institute for Integrated Circuits, Johannes Kepler University.

The regular updates from Stefan's Zip-file are tracked (last update 2022/03/17).

For exemplary use of this LaTeX package, see `demo_circdia.tex`. This package has also been used to create the circuit figures in this publication: <https://doi.org/10.1109/MSSC.2021.3088968>

Changes versus the original package:

* Added MOSFET symbols according to Razavi book style (elements `nmos`, `nmos*`, `pmos`, `pmos*`).
* Added new VDD/VSS symbols according to Razavi book style (elements `iicvdd` and `iicvss`).
* Tweaked the appearance of resistor and capacitor symbols to make them a bit more pleasing.
